<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A common way to define <i>institutions </i>is to treat them simply as 
organisations that tend to persist over time. A stricter definition, and closer 
to the one we use here, is to treat them as the noun form of the verb root: &quot;to 
institute,&quot; i.e., to put into practice, to habituate. Thus, one meaning of<i> 
institutions </i>in the <a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary </a>is &quot;the giving of form or order 
to a thing; orderly arrangement; regulation.&quot; Related to this is &quot;an 
established law, custom, usage, practice, organisation, or other element in the 
political or social life of a people; a regulative principle or convention 
subservient to the needs of an organised community or the general ends of 
civilization.&quot; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The following definition of <i>institutions</i> 
is 
taken from
<a href="http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/1993/north-lecture.html">
Douglass North's 1993 Nobel Prize Lecture</a>:</font></p>
<p><font color="#CC0000" face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Institutions are the humanly devised 
constraints that structure human interaction. They are made up of formal 
constraints (rules, laws, constitutions), informal constraints (norms of behaviour, conventions, and self imposed codes of conduct), and their enforcement 
characteristics. Together they define the incentive structure of societies and 
specifically economies.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One needn't be wedded to
<a href="http://encyclo.findlaw.com/0530book.pdf">New Institutional Economics
</a>to find this characterisation useful for understanding the circumstances under 
which corrupt practices can flourish. Rather, in the context of corruption, it more broadly expresses the milieu of 
both formal 
and informal--and economic and social--incentives and penalties in which individuals and social groups typically make decisions as to whether or not it is worth engaging in corrupt behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
