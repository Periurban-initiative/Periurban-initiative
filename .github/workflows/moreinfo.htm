                      Within any given sphere (e.g., legislative, economic, judicial), 
                      corruption is largely the outcome of a breakdown in legitimate 
                      or just institutions (i.e., formal and informal rules, habits--North, 
                      1990), leading to unfair or arbitrary institutions. This 
                      is not to deny the important role of individuals as agents 
                      of corruption; nevertheless, corrupt behavior is most likely 
                      to take place routinely only in those circumstances where 
                      prevailing rules and practices either fail to prevent it 
                      or actively condone it. In some instances, the ambiguity 
                      of conflicting institutions in overlapping domains, or the 
                      absence of clarity in the rules, could also increase the 
                      scope for corruption. Thus, it is the <i>institutional failure</i> 
                      to stem the routine use of public resources for private 
                      gain that amounts to the breach of public trust that we 
                      term corruption. Such a breach of trust could occur at various 
                      sites within the entire network of social, economic and 
                      political relationships within a country (see Figure).<BR>
                      <BR>
                      The conceptual model used here conceives of the social, 
                      economic and political spheres of any given country as constituting 
                      a system with institutional flows. Barriers, blockages and 
                      diversions of these flows appear figuratively as "breaches", 
                      and more specifically as opportunities for increasing corruption.

                      <SPAN class=hed10px>DSTAIR is a Decision Support Tool to 
                      Analyze Institutional Reform. The tool merely assists analysts 
                      and country experts in generating "legitimacy" scores for 
                      different spheres of government, civil society and economic 
                      activity within a country based on the ratings they provide 
                      to questions relating to institutional arrangements. Where 
                      these arrangements (rules and practices) are robust, the 
                      user is encouraged to assign a high rating. Where these 
                      are poor, the rating is expected to be low. Aggregate and 
                      normalized scores based on the ratings provide the user 
                      a quick view of the legitimacy of different spheres. The 
                      user may then examine a suite of anti-corruption tools that 
                      could be deployed in response, and review case studies appropriate 
                      to each tool in order to gain a fuller appreciation of past 
                      applications of the tool. DSTAIR also provides the user 
                      with an indication of which anti-corruption tools most likely 
                      to be of value, based on the particular combination of legitimacy 
                      scores earned by the different spheres. </span><BR> </TD>

                      <SPAN class=hed10px>DSTAIR is currently divided into nine 
                      "spheres": Constitution, Legislature, Executive, Administration, 
                      Judiciary, Political Parties, Civil Society, Economic Sphere, 
                      and Media. The premise is that each sphere operates through 
                      a finite set of especially important institutional arrangements, 
                      and that when the "quality" of several of these arrangements 
                      suffers, the legitimacy of the sphere as a whole is adversely 
                      affected. Moreover, bad institutional effects can "propagate" 
                      to other spheres. For example, a Judiciary that has a poor 
                      system of judicial appointment not only diminishes its own 
                      legitimacy but also reflects badly on the Legislature, the 
                      Executive and the Constitution. <BR>
                      <BR>
                      The institutional arrangements relevant to each sphere are 
                      as follows: one set concerns the legitimacy of the "meta-rules," 
                      i.e., the institutions that are important for formation 
                      of the sphere itself (e.g., judicial appointments); another 
                      set determines the legitimacy of the rules developed by 
                      the sphere (e.g., judgments); a third concerns exogenous 
                      factors (e.g., intimidation of judges by rogue elements 
                      in civil society). The user assigns scores and weights for 
                      all these arrangements. Advanced users could also determine 
                      the relative weights of the influence of/from other spheres 
                      of specific arrangements. A normalized score of legitimacy 
                      within each sphere is thereby derived.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      Note that legitimacy, as defined here, stands for a combined 
                      measure of the effectiveness and legitimacy of the rules 
                      making up each sphere and the rules it generates, as well 
                      as some exogenous factors that cannot necessarily be changed 
                      by institutional design, like wars or resource problems. 
                      But this can also be "attenuated" by the legitimacy of other 
                      spheres, and so there is some limited modeling of the interaction 
                      among the spheres. For instance, a bad Constitution will 
                      have an impact on the legitimacy of the Economic sphere 
                      to the extent that there are rule linkages between the two.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      A set of 28 anti-corruption tools, each of which require 
                      that legitimacy scores in the nine spheres are greater than 
                      pre-specified threshold levels in order that the tool be 
                      "triggered," are then compared against the scores. In the 
                      current version, the threshold values of legitimacy scores 
                      are based entirely on the developers' judgment, but will 
                      be modified with the help of expert advice others. Since 
                      the institutional scores are all normalized between 0 and 
                      1, it is likely that after gaining some experience using 
                      DSTAIR, expert judgment will likely converge on the best 
                      threshold levels to adopt. </span><BR> </TD>

                      { I <font size=-2>j</font> } for each sphere is first computed 
                      by adding up that sphere’s weighted scores (i.e, rating 
                      multiplied by importance level -– low = 1, medium = 2, and 
                      high = 3). These are "normalized" with respect to the maximum 
                      possible scores to get a result between 0 and 1. The internal 
                      score is then "attenuated" based on the level of influence 
                      from other spheres. In principle, the legitimacy of any 
                      given sphere can be affected by nearly any other--the level 
                      of influence is something that advanced users may decide 
                      to alter. Computationally, these influences are currently 
                      hard-wired to play only a small role in altering the final 
                      legitimacy score, but this effect may be changed in future 
                      versions based on suggestions from users. <BR>
