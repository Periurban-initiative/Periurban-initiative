              A wide-ranging treatment of the subject, the UN Toolkit begins with 
              a brief introduction, which is followed by dozens of tools and relevant 
              case studies; addressing institutional vulnerabilities, societal 
              and situtational prevention, enforcement, monitoring, evaluation, 
              international legal cooperation and recovery. Though no comprehensive 
              tool kit exists, this package certainly covers the broadest range 
              of governance and society, and was utilized extensively in the formation 
              of DSTAIR's suite of tools. The full report can be at the <A

              A guide based on successful case studies which aims to empower civil 
              society to combat corruption itself, while simultaneously engaging 
              the private and governmental sectors to do their parts. Encourages 
              users to identify which of the tools would be most useful based 
              on the case information and suggested variations supplied.<BR>
              The 2004 edition also included two special editions, one entitled 
              "Teaching Integrity to Youth" and a second entitled "Transparency

                    Directed at USAID members and partner organizations in organizing 
                    their anti-corruption campaigns. The handbook has not been 
                    updated since its publication in 1999. Oriented toward the 
                    goals of the donor nation/programme provider in completing 
                    their development projects successfully and in facilitating 
                    trade, rather than towards the goal of eliminating corruption 
                    for the sake of the host/recipient country itself. Thus the 
                    tools it provides mainly recommend applying American-model 
                    free market institutional reforms.<BR>

              efforts on a municipal scale. Features many case studies on their 
              applications, may be especially helpful in targeted campaigns, or 
              smaller, compact countries.<BR>
