					<img style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px"src="img/corruption.jpg" width="168" height="111" align=left><SPAN class=hed10px>Corruption is the use of public resources for private gain – a betrayal of the public confidence invested in individuals with access to public resources. Corrupt practices are found in all branches of government, in business, and even within civil society. The broader consequences are a slowing down, or even reversal, of development goals, particularly in countries that are most vulnerable to economic downturns and political upheaval. Within any given sphere (e.g., legislative, economic, judicial), corruption is largely the outcome of a breakdown in legitimate or just 
					rules and practices (<a href="institutions.htm" target="_blank">institutions</a>), leading to unfair or arbitrary institutions.<BR>

                      <b>DSTAIR</b> is a web-based decision support system that 
                      provides a platform for analyzing the effectiveness of

                      country. It then presents a suite of anti-corruption tools,

                    <TD vAlign=top width=550 bgColor=white> <SPAN class=hed10px>Instead of 
					making an overall judgment about a country, DSTAIR 
                      looks for institutional weaknesses in each of the many core 
					spheres of the state and society: the constitution, courts, legislature, the executive, 
					administration, political 
                      parties, media, the economy, and civil society. It assumes 
					that both the formal rules and informal practices in these 
					spheres are important determinants of their overall 
					legitimacy. DSTAIR is user driven; the program prompts 
                      users to make their own assessment about which particular 
                      institutions are legitimate and which are most in need of reform. Policy recommendations 
                      which utilize legitimate institutions are identified by tabulating the user's assessments. The flexibility of the DSTAIR allows 
                      users to compare their own judgment with that of others, 
                      and to review alternative recommendations until they find 
                      what matches their needs.<BR>

					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesinos" target="_blank">Montesinos</a> case illustrates how 
					corruption networks can spread across a broad spectrum of 
					the state and society, especially when fostered by 
					institutional failings in multiple spheres. In Peru during t</span><SPAN class=hed10px>he</span><SPAN class=hed10px> 1990's, intelligence service chief Alberto Montesinos tried to bribe anyone who could be useful t</span><SPAN class=hed10px>o the then president, Alberto Fujimori. But since he also videotaped all his meetings (the adjacent frame depicts one such transaction), investigators like <a href="http://drclas.fas.harvard.edu/revista/tcontents_issue.php?issue=12&article=168" target="_blank">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> have been able to piece together a vast corruption  
                  </span><SPAN class=hed10px>network that involves individuals in virtually all spheres of the Peruvian polity and society. 
					That neither the courts nor the media were immune from 
					involvement in this network meant that there were virtually 
					no institutional safeguards left to protect the average 
					Peruvian citizen from the negative impacts of corruption. The image below provides a schematic of the multiple entanglements of corruption in the Montesinos case (Adapted from: <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance" target="_blank">World Bank Institute</a>).
